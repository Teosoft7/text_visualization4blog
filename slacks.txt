Good morning @channel!

This Tuesday evening, Flatiron School is hosting an event that's closely related to what we're studying: a panel discussion on ethics and responsibility in deep learning, with an emphasis on natural language processing.

The moderators are our very own Sherry and Mia.

If you have friends who are curious about what you're up to here, please invite them!

I added another `for` loop to show how this "grows closer to the normal bell curve" over time:
```for i in range(1, 10):
    means = []
    for _ in range(5*2**i):
        means.append(np.mean(stats.expon.rvs(size=100)))

    # Let's make a histogram. Suppose we choose about 50 bins.

    plt.hist(means, bins=50)
    plt.title(f"{5 * 2 ** i} repeated samples (size=100) of the pop")
    plt.show()```
this will double the number of times that we sample the population, starting from using 10 samples, and then doubling this number 9 more times (edited)

Hi classmates! My Airbnb host for June cancelled on me this morning, so I'm actively looking for open rooms for the month of June. Please reach out if you know of any availabilities or leads for sublets/airbnbs/short-term rentals/etc in the Seattle area. Ideally speaking, it would be a private room & bathroom, but at this point anything with a solid roof & commutable to class does the trick. Please message me if you know of anything! Thanks!

for my blog, I'm trying to generate "fake" data with `np.random` to simulate y=A*B^x and another with y=A*x^n   (exponential vs power model)  what is the best way to do this so that I don't get a "perfect line" of scatterpoint plots, but rather something that looks more realistic

edit:  or maybe it's better to just use *actual* data instead of wasting time trying to simulate something. Thoughts? (edited)

so, in Step 4: Calculating n requires us to know the variance ... but then later they tell us to use `var = n * p * (1 - p)` so now we need to know n to get var, which we use to find n. This seems like circular logic, what are we missing?

Special thanks to @Kayli Leung for filing this ticket pointing out a very technical important error in the text re Bayes Theorem:
https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-2-21-12-PE-MAP/issues/1

We'll get it fixed.

In the meantime, please refer to this authoritative reference:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem#Statement_of_theorem (edited) 
Wikipedia
Bayes' theorem
In probability theory and statistics, Bayes' theorem (alternatively Bayes' law or Bayes' rule) describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. For example, if cancer is related to age, then, using Bayes' theorem, a person's age can be used to more accurately assess the probability that they have cancer, compared to the assessment of the probability of cancer made without knowledge of the person's age.
One of the many applications of Bayes' theorem is Bayesian inference, a particular approach to statistical inference. When applied, the probabilities involved in Bayes' theorem may have different probability interpretations. With the Bayesian probability interpretation the theorem expresses how a degree of belief, expressed as a probability, should rationally change to account for availability of related evidence. Bayesian inference is fundamental to Bayesian statistics.
Bayes' theorem is named after Reverend Thomas Bayes (; 1701?–1761), who first used conditional probability to provide an algorithm (his Proposition 9) that uses evidence to calculate limits on an unknown parameter, published as  An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances (1763). In what he called a scholium, Bayes extended his algorithm to any unknown prior cause.  Independently of Bayes, Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1774, and later in his 1812 "Théorie analytique des probabilités" used conditional probability to formulate the relation of an updated posterior probability from a prior probability, given evidence. Sir Harold Jeffreys put Bayes's algorithm and Laplace's formulation on an axiomatic basis. Jeffreys wrote that Bayes' theorem "is to the theory of probability what the Pythagorean theorem is to geometry".

Rubber duck debugging
In software engineering, rubber duck debugging is a method of debugging code. The name is a reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck. Many other terms exist for this technique, often involving different inanimate objects.
Many programmers have had the experience of explaining a problem to someone else, possibly even to someone who knows nothing about programming, and then hitting upon the solution in the process of explaining the problem. In describing what the code is supposed to do and observing what it actually does, any incongruity bet… Show more

is there a way to find blogs of people you follow on medium short of searching the individual titles?

Greg Damico [3:03 PM]
A general word of caution: It's best (for now) to avoid using 'data scientist' to describe yourself on LinkedIn, unless you've actually held that job title before. Precisely because it sounds more like a job title than an answer to a question about your hobbies, employers may feel a bit duped if they encounter folks without that title advertising themselves as such.

None of this answers the question about how you _should_ portray yourself, which, I admit, is not totally straightforward. But 'data science student' works pretty well (and has far less risk of misleading anyone).
